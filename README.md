# Code Challenge - Anagrams

Michael Xuan Nguyen's coding challenge for javascript develpoment.

In order to run this program, run a nnpm install, and run the main.js file using the node command. It is a command line version of the prompt.
Currently, all of the code should work, however I am having issues with my asychronous functions not running asynchronoulsy, and I cannot seem to solve them. If I was given more time, I would solve this issue and the app would work perfectly.

When guessing, the first letter of the word can be hinted by typing "hint" as your guess.
